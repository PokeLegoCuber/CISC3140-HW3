# CISC3140-HW3
Assignment 3 for CISC 3140 class

This project demonstrates the use of [Travis CI] and [Heroku]

This project adds onto [CISC3140-HW1]

This project was made with the [Flask framework] and the [NASA Astronomy Picture of the Day(APOD) API].

The goal of this project was to get [Travis CI](a continous intergration platform for GitHub) and [Heroku](cloud platform for hosting web apps) to connect to each other.

My understanding of how things work(feel free to correct me) is Travis CI will setup your project's enviroment and checks if there are any errors. Once if successfully builds the enviroment it talks to Heroku and deploys your application onto the web! If it finds an error it'll halt and not deploy the appilcation.
